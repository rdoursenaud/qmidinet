QmidiNet - A MIDI Network Gateway via UDP/IP Multicast
------------------------------------------------------

QmidiNet is a MIDI network gateway application that sends and receives
MIDI data (ALSA Sequencer [2] and/or JACK MIDI [3]) over the network, using
UDP/IP multicast. Inspired by multimidicast (https://llg.cubic.org/tools)
and designed to be compatible with ipMIDI for Windows (https://nerds.de).

Requirements
------------

The software requirements for build and runtime are listed as follows:

  Mandatory:

  [1] Qt framework, C++ class library and tools for
        cross-platform application and UI development
        https://qt.io/

  [2] ALSA, Advanced Linux Sound Architecture
        https://www.alsa-project.org/

  Optional (opted-in at build time):

  [3] JACK Audio Connection Kit
        https://jackaudio.org/

  
Installation
------------

Unpack the tarball and in the extracted source directory:

    cmake [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local] -B build -S .
    make -C build

and optionally as root:

    sudo make -C build install

See also the README.cmake file in the source distribution.


Configuration
-------------

QmidiNet holds its settings and configuration state per user, in a file
located as $HOME/.config/rncbc.org/QmidiNet.conf . Normally, there's no
need to edit this file, as it is recreated and rewritten everytime
qmidinet is run.


Bugs
----

Plenty still, after all this is alpha software ;)
